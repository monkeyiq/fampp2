27-Oct-2000 Ben Martin  (VERSION 0.0.3)

	* Added FamSingleton class to header. See gpdial_applet for an example of usage (check freshmeat).
	* Added getInstance_gnome_and_wait_user_wants_to_quit exception and getInstance_gnome_and_wait().
		getInstance_gnome_and_wait will keep polling for fam to be available, and also show
		a dialog box so that the user can close the application if fam does not become available.

23-Oct-2000 Ben Martin

	* Created famstatic.hh after I started using this wrapper in
	  anger. I found that there were issues with non template functions
	  being multiply defined. Old code will need to include famstatic.hh
	  now. I don't think anyone is using fam++ at the moment though :-0

	* Updated the examples to use famstatic.hh too.


9-July-2000 Ben Martin

	* Fixed bug where fampp would keep a stale reference to
		each FamppRequest even after the FamppRequest was deleted().

	* Fixed bug where after FamppRequest lookup in fampp no check
		was made if the request was == null. (possible segv was there).

	* Added GPL COPYING and header comments to all cpp and header
		files indicating GPL.

	* Created a README

	* Created this file
