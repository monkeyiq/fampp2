A C++ wrapper for fam from sgi.
fam can be found at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/

fam uses imon to inform it when inodes change, the net 
effect being that applications can register interest
in a file, and have events send to the application 
when the file changes.

The fam++ wrapper (hopefully) makes fam a little easier
to use. It does this by using exceptions instead of 
return values to indicate error, allow type safe
callbacks using boost and compile time checking.
